Assignment: Count every word in a space delineated word file using a binary search tree for indexing.

I decided to go above and beyond later when I had free time.
I completed the BST implementation and made it optionally self balancing.
(Note: I was using a separate school based account for this project. 
I have now transfered it to my personal, true account)
